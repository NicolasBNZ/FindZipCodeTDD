Find zip code app in TDD + React + TypeScript

Let's create again my old app to find a city in France by its zip code.
But this type, I will do it in TDD. 
It means, I will begin with unit tests. Tests I think that are mandatory for the future feature working.

In this markdown file, I will write my journey. 

**Github repository
I create a rep√¥sitory on github (I would prefer gitlab, but my old findazipcode app is on this github)

**Configure my EDI

**Create branches
I won't work on "main". I will only use it to merge features when they will be operational
A branch "develop", it s a "monorepo". The branch to test the app before send it to "main" (in production)
Others branches, one by feature.
